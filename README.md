# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction for Ethereum (ETH), Arbitrum (ARB), and Chainlink (LINK)

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the prices of three major cryptocurrencies—Ethereum (ETH), Arbitrum (ARB), and Chainlink (LINK)—for the period from June 5th to June 18th, 2024. The prediction model utilizes various key metrics and advanced analytical techniques to provide accurate and reliable forecasts.

## Methodology

1. **Historical Price Analysis**:
   - Analyze historical price data to understand variance and identify patterns.
   - Evaluate intra-day movements to capture volatility and price fluctuations.

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Identify cryptocurrencies with the strongest and weakest correlations with ETH, ARB, and LINK.
   - Observe how these correlations change over time and incorporate them into the model.

3. **Market Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Use Google Trends data to capture market sentiment and public interest.
   - Analyze the impact of social media trends, news sentiment, and other alternative data sources on price movements.

4. **Model Development and Backtesting**:
   - Develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
   - Backtest the model on historical data to assess accuracy and reliability.
   - Continuously refine the model based on backtesting results to enhance predictive power.
